# Project2

This R Shiny app allows users to explore the mobile phone dataset from kaggle. Users can choose which numeric variables to include, as well as choose which levels of each categorical variable to include in plot generation. The tabs can then be used to explore the output given by subsetting.

The app can be run locally by opening the app.R file in RStudio and clicking on "Run App".
